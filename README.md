# Cloudflare Stream

A minimalistic node.js package for easily uploading videos to [Cloudflare Stream](https://developers.cloudflare.com/stream/).

## Getting Started

Let's start off by installing the package via NPM.

```sh
npm i cloudflare-stream
```

Once you've done that, you're going to want to create an instance of a [CloudflareStream](#cloudflarestream) with your [credentials](#credentials).

```js
const CloudflareStream = require('cloudflare-stream').CloudflareStream;

const uploader = new CloudflareStream({
  email: 'sam@example.com', // cloudflare email address
  key: 'c23864bc3ada9bf9c937810f62bb69a4e90b0' // cloudflare api key
});
```

Now that you've made an instance, you're going to want to upload your video to your zone.
Let's create an [upload](#uploaduploadoptions) with your [upload options](#uploadoptions).

```js
const upload = uploader.upload({
  zone: 'ca4239cdd6a52cec1e916a6cd0e2f629', // cloudflare zone id
  path: './videos/demo-video.mp4' // path to video on filesystem
});
```

The [upload](#uploaduploadoptions) method returns an [EventEmitter](https://nodejs.org/api/events.html#events_class_eventemitter) which has three events ([progress](#uploadeventprogressmessage), [success](#uploadeventsuccessmessage), [error](#uploadeventerrormessage)).

Let's create some logs from your [upload events](#upload-events).

```js
upload.on('progress', (progress) => {
  console.log(`${progress.precentage} of upload completed (${progress.uploaded} bytes / ${progress.total} bytes)`);
});

upload.on('error', (error) => {
  console.log('An error has occurred', error);
});

upload.on('success', (response) => {
  console.log(response);
});
```


## API Documentation

### CloudflareStream
```ts
class CloudflareStream {

  constructor(credentials: CloudflareCredentials);

  upload(uploadOptions: CloudflareUpload);

}
```

#### constructor(credentials)

##### credentials

```ts
type CloudflareCredentials {
  email,
  key,
  zone?
}
```

##### credentials.email

An ```email``` is always required, it should be the email address which you use to sign in with Cloudflare.

##### credentials.key

A ```key``` is always required, it should be the [API Key](https://support.cloudflare.com/hc/en-us/articles/200167836-Where-do-I-find-my-Cloudflare-API-key-
) which matches the email address which you use to sign in with Cloudflare.

##### credentials.zone

If a ```zone``` is not set in the ```uploadOptions``` of an instance method, then a ```zone``` is required in the ```credentials```.

A ```zone``` must be a valid [Cloudflare DNS Zone](https://www.cloudflare.com/learning/dns/glossary/dns-zone/) which is accessable using the specified email address and API key.


#### upload(uploadOptions)

Returns an [EventEmitter](https://nodejs.org/api/events.html#events_class_eventemitter) with three events ([progress](#uploadeventprogressmessage), [success](#uploadeventsuccessmessage), [error](#uploadeventerrormessage)).

##### uploadOptions
```ts
type CloudflareUpload {
  zone?,
  path?,
  buffer?
}
```

##### uploadOptions.zone

If a ```zone``` has not been set in the constructor, then a ```zone``` is required in the ```uploadOptions```.

A ```zone``` must be a valid [Cloudflare DNS Zone](https://www.cloudflare.com/learning/dns/glossary/dns-zone/) which is accessable using the specified email address and API key.

If a ```zone``` has already been set in the constructor, this value will overwrite it.

##### uploadOptions.path
If a ```buffer``` has not been set in the ```uploadOptions```, then a ```path``` is required.

A ```path``` must be a string pointing to a video file on the local filesystem. 

It can be either an absolute path or a path relative to the node.js process (```process.cwd()```).

##### uploadOptions.zone

If a ```path``` has not been set in the ```uploadOptions```, then a ```buffer``` is required.

A ```buffer``` must be a valid node.js [Buffer](https://nodejs.org/api/buffer.html#buffer_class_buffer).
